# 💬 WhatsApp AI Chatbot using Twilio, Flask, and Gemini API

This is a simple WhatsApp chatbot built using Python, Flask, Twilio, and Google's Gemini AI (Generative AI). It receives messages via WhatsApp and replies with intelligent responses generated by Gemini's LLM.

## 🚀 Features

- Receive WhatsApp messages via Twilio
- Process user input using Gemini 1.5 Flash API
- Respond with AI-generated answers
- Maintains context using a chat history from `trainingdata.py`
- Web interface with `index.html` (optional UI)

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- A [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/)
- A verified Twilio WhatsApp sandbox
- Google Gemini API key
- Flask
- `trainingdata.py` file containing chat history

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/whatsapp-ai-chatbot.git
   cd whatsapp-ai-chatbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install flask twilio google-generativeai
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables (or replace directly in code):**

   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`

4. **Update Twilio Sandbox:**

   - Set your webhook URL in the [Twilio console](https://www.twilio.com/console) to point to your `/whatsapp` endpoint.
   - For local testing, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/):

     ```bash
     ngrok http 5000
     ```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A message is sent to your Twilio WhatsApp number.
2. Twilio triggers a POST request to `/whatsapp`.
3. The app receives the message and sends it to Gemini for a response.
4. The AI's response is sent back to the user via Twilio.

---

## 📝 Example

```python
message_body = "Tell me a joke"
from_number = "whatsapp:+1234567890"
```

Response:

```
Why did the computer show up at work late?
Because it had a hard drive!
```

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- The Gemini response is trimmed to ~1600 characters to fit Twilio limits.
- Always secure your API keys—avoid hardcoding them in production.
- This is a prototype and should be enhanced with rate limiting, validation, and error handling for production use.
