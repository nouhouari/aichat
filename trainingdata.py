Adults, on the other hand, should aim to consume at least 10 grams per day, with an ideal daily intake ranging from 15 to 20 grams.\nFor dehydrated spirulina: Children below 12 should aim for a minimum of 1 gram per day and ideally 3 grams per day, while adults should consume at least 5 grams per day and ideally 10 grams per day.\nItâ€™s important to note that higher quantities can be consumed as spirulina is a natural food and not a chemical product.\n\nWhy do we suggest this approach?
